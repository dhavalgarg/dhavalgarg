### Hey there, I'm Dhaval :grin:
I am a MS in Data Science at University of Rochester graduate. I have been in the data domain for about 2 years now. I love to deal with data. It can be in creating pipelines, analyzing data, predicting using data etc. I will use this platform to showcase some of the projects I have worked on. Feel free to contact me if you have any pointers or doubts.
